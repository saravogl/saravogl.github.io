					<p>Hey, it’s me. Sara without an ‘h’.  I’m not sure how you found your way to my page, but I’m glad you’re here!</p>

					<p>If you already know a thing or two about me, feel free to skip ahead. For those of you who I’ve never met, let’s take a minute to get virtually acquainted, shall we?</p>

					<p>First things first: I’m *really* proud to say I built this site from the ground up. No template, no WordPress, no Squarespace -- just good ‘ole HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript. It’s still a work in progress, so feel free to let me know your thoughts -- the good, the bad, and the ugly. (I grew up with a brother so I know how to take a punch…or two, or three, or four.)</p>

					<p>Speaking of growing up: I was raised in Michigan and found my way to Chicago by way of Loyola University Chicago (go Ramblers!). I’ve always been a lover of people, places, and ideas, so it didn’t take long for Chicago to feel like home to me. This city is full of amazing people, and I want to try get to know (and learn from) as many of them as possible.</p>

					<p>I’m a huge believer in seeking-out challenges, trusting your instincts, and letting that space between where you are and where you want to be inspire and motivate you to do big things.</p>

					<p>What about you?</p>

			  	<h2><span>life</span>work</h2>

					<p>Growing up, I was always jealous of those people who knew *exactly* what they wanted to be when they grew up. Sure, not all of my friends realized their dreams of becoming astronauts or the President of the United States, but a lot of my classmates did grow up to be doctors, teachers, firemen, nurses, and scientists -- which is incredible, when you think about it. Me? I'm still one of the many trying to figure out what I want to be when I grow up -- but I try not to see that as a weakness; it's an opportunity to try new things, isn't it? At this point in my life, I define success by taking advantage of the opportunity to learn as much as I can at my job, taking initiative and seeking out new education opportunities (like the rad <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> course that helped me build this site), and constantly challenging myself to think creatively and unconventionally.</p>

					<p>Now that you know a bit about me, I have to confess that I am currently living a double-life -- and I love it. By-day I’m a Director of Client Services for an enrollment and marketing services company, and by night I’m a Cardio Dance instructor at various studios and gyms around the city. Interested in talking business? <a href="#say-hello" class="hello">Say hello</a>. Want to dance it out together? <a href="#lets-dance" class="dance">Come join me at a class</a>. We can even combine both options, if you're into it.</p>

					<p>Oh! Take a look at my <a href="resume/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> if you have a minute.</p>

				<h2><span>let's</span>dance</h2>

					<p>As a dance instructor, my goal is to help women (and men!) feel confident and comfortable in their own skin. This is something we all struggle with on a daily basis and the best way that I know to combat these negative thoughts is in the studio. You’d be surprised how much your attitude, stress-level, and mindset can change in 60-minutes when the music is blasting and you’re booty-shakin’ with a bunch of kick-ass women. Don’t believe me? Come sweat it out with me at one of my classes:</p>
