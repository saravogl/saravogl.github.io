	  <h2>about</h2>

	  	<p>Hello, it's me. I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything they say that time's supposed to heal, yeah. But I ain't done much healing. Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be, when we were younger and free. I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet. There's such a difference between us, and a million miles.</p>

	  	<p>Hello from the other side. I must've called a thousand times, to tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done, but when I call you never seem to be home. Hello from the outside. At least I can say that I've tried, to tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart, but it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.</p>

	  <h2>work</h2>

		<p>Boys workin' on empty. Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat? I just think about my baby. I'm so full of love I could barely eat. There's nothing sweeter than my baby. I'd never want once from the cherry tree. 'Cause my baby's sweet as can be. She give me toothaches just from kissin' me. When, my, time comes around, lay me gently in the cold dark earth. No grave can hold my body down, I'll crawl home to her.</p>

		<p>That's when my baby found me. I was three days on a drunken sin. I woke with her walls around me, nothin' in her room but an empty crib. And I was burnin' up a fever. I didn't care much how long I lived. But I swear I thought I dreamed her, she never asked me once about the wrong I did.</p>

		<p>If you care to take a look, here's my <a href="#">resume</a>.</p>
