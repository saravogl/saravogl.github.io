// Page will open to h1 and nav cenetered on page with full-stretch background image

// Two options for page navigation: 

// Option 1: User clicks on nav links...

// When user clicks on a nav link, page will scroll to the appropriate section.
// Nav bar will be fixed to the top of the page permanently as the user scrolls.

// Option 2: User scrolls...

// When user scrolls, nav bar becomes permanently fixed to the top of the page

// Notes: I'm in the process of figuring out the styling of my page, which makes
// it difficult to think through other js and jquery methods at this time. By next 
// week/end, I plan to have fleshed out my content a bit more (right now, it's mostly
// song lyrics) and have a better idea for the styling of my page. But I think taking 
// some time this week to research and look around the web will help me find some ideas 
// and challenges to take on for my css and js.
